<!-- Having struggled with understanding how the Spotify OAuth flow works, I made the course I wish I could have had.

Unlike tutorials that only cover a few concepts and leave you with half-baked GitHub repositories, this course covers everything from explaining the principles of REST APIs to implementing Spotify's OAuth flow and fetching API data in a React app. By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have an app deployed to the internet you can add to your portfolio. -->

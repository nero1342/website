An interactive retrieval system for visual data with multiple effective filter algorithms to search and retrieve relevant images fast and accurately.

Unlike other retrieval systems, we provide an segmentation mask as an explanability for the retrieval results.

Integrated and took advantages from OpenAI's CLIP to align text prompts and images. Converted, stored and indexed millions of images as vector embeddings using Milvus.

Got 10/10 in thesis defense, First Prize in Student Scientific Research Award(EURÃ‰KA).
